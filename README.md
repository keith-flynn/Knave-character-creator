## Background Information
[What is a funnel?](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/51227/what-is-a-funnel)

``` A "funnel" is an adventure designed to take in a large number of 1st- or 0th-level characters and spit out just the survivors, if any. The metaphor is the shape of the PC tool: large at the entrance, small at the exit.```

In a funnel adventure you do not start as a level 3 fighter, or even a level 1 wizard. Your character(s) are not even adventurers. You will control several level 0 peasants who are not cut out for adventuring and in all liklihood will perish soon. Your real strength is numbers, as everyone at your table will control their own part of the angry peasant mob.

This rules toolkit has a simple yet vibrant character trait generation system which works well for churning out unique adventurers. The only drawback is the time it takes to roll and reference all of your starting traits, which is automated with this project.

Knave's ruleset synergizes extremely well with [Dungeon Crawl Classic](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/101050/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg-dcc-rpg)
